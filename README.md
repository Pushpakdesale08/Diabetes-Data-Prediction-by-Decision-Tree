# Diabetes-Data-Prediction-by-Decision-Tree

This project uses a Decision Tree algorithm to predict the likelihood of diabetes in patients based on key medical attributes. 
The dataset includes features such as Pregnancies, Glucose, BloodPressure, SkinThickness, Insulin, BMI, Age. 
The model is trained, evaluated, and tuned to achieve optimal accuracy for predicting diabetes. 
The code is easy to follow and demonstrates basic data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

Key Features:

1. Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, normalization, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.

2. Model Implementation: A Decision Tree classifier is trained to predict whether a patient has diabetes or not.

3. Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix are used to evaluate the model's performance.

4. Visual representation of the Decision Tree.
